# Basic JavaScript Instructions  

**Scripts** are a series of statements that tell the console what to do 
- very precise *(e.g. might need to specify value to be remembered before using that value)*  

**Variables** temporarily store information used in the script  

**Arrays** (variable) stores more than one piece of related information  

JS distinguishes btn:
1. Numbers (0-9) and math with this numbers  
2. Strings (text) but doesn't necessarily know what the text is saying  
3. Boolean values (true or false)  

**Expressions** evaluate into single value 
- rely on operators to calculate a value
