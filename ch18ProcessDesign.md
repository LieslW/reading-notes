# Process & Design  

**Target Audience** is an important determiner in the design of your site 
- *e.g. Individuals? Companies? Income? Occupation?*  
- Website needs to meet the goals and motivations of your users  

**Site Maps** help structure the site 
- provides an outline to what you want the site to look like and what information it will provide  

**Wireframes** are similar to site maps but much more simple  
- gives a more visually accurate representation on what your site will look like  

**Visual Design** is about communicating with your users  
- Components: content, priority, and organization   
  - Provide necessary and appropiate *content*  
  - Use **visual hierarchy** to *prioritze* your content  
  - Group together related content to *organize* your site  
    - e.g. size, color, font, etc.
