# The ABC of Programming  

## What is JavaScript?  

**Scripts** are a series of instructions for the computer  
- Computers think logically and need to be told very specfic instructions and definitions
- Some instructions are more complicated than others so you need to break it down into a series of steps   
1. **Define** the goal   
2. **Design** the script   
3. **Code** each step

## How do computers fit in?  

**Computers** create models of the world using data 
- computer doesn't neccessarily know what it's rendering

**Objects** are physical things in the world  
- ***Properties***: characteristics of said objects  
- ***Events***: initial interaction with the object(s)
  - leads the computer to the next step of instructions 
    - e.g. "When this occurs, do this"
- ***Methods***: further interaction with the object(s)  
  - depending on interaction can vary the result
    - e.g. like a math equation where if you change the numbers, the answer is different 

HTML and CSS design a model of your web page. JS lets users interact with the web page.

## How do scripts for a web page work?  

*HTML* establishes the content on the page  
*CSS* designs the content  

**JS** gives the content its behavior 
- keep JS code within own JS file
- code JS within HTML using the `<script>` element 
  - similar to `<link>` element for CSS files 
- JS does not change HTML
