# Introducing CSS  


**CSS** is in charge of the design around your webpage
- *Think of it like little boxes around everything* 
- Rules made up of selectors and declarations dictate how things should look
  - ***Boxes***: width, height, borders, bckgd color, images, position
  - ***Text***: typeface, size color, style  

There are a variety of **selectors** that target different elements 
- *e.g. header, body, main, div, etc.*

There are a variety of **declarations** that dictate what the elements should look like 
- *properties*: what do you want to change? *(e.g. background-color)*  
- *values*: what is the change? *(red)*

*CSS appears in own separate document, but can appear within HTML page
