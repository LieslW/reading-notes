## Growth Mindset 
  Those with a growth mindset look to:
  - Overcome challenges and obstacles 
  - Strategize problems and solutions 
  - Establish a progressive and positive attitude in both the workplace and learning environment 
  - Constantly look for areas of improvement in both their work and environment 
  - Challenge themselves to improve their skillset
 ### Keep Up That Growth! 
 1. Don't let an obstacle bring you down; see it as a chance to improve! 
 2. No pain no gain 
 3. It's never too late to ask for help
