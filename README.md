Hello! My name is Liesl (she/her) and I look forward to learning about Markdown! Here's my profile: https://github.com/LieslW
## Growth Mindset 
  Those with a growth mindset look to:
  - Overcome challenges and obstacles 
  - Strategize problems and solutions 
  - Establish a progressive and positive attitude in both the workplace and learning environment 
  - Constantly look for areas of improvement in both their work and environment 
  - Challenge themselves to improve their skillset
 ### Keep Up That Growth! 
 1. Don't let an obstacle bring you down; see it as a chance to improve! 
 2. No pain no gain 
 3. It's never too late to ask for help   
## Markdown: Basic Syntax 
***Headings***  
Headings are indicated by the "#" and dependent on how many of these you use will result in various sized headings. For example  

"#" = Level 1 
# This is a Level 1 Heading 
"##" = Level 2 
## This is a Level 2 Heading 
And so forth...  
This is similar to HTML's h1, h2, h3,... heading styles.  
*Don't forget the space between your # and your heading title. Otherwise it will look like this*  

#This is my Heading when I forget the space.  

***Paragraphs***  
Paragraphs are much more simple. All you need to do is type in your text and separate it with a blank line...

...like this!  
*Don't try formatting your text in Markdown. The computer does it for you!*  

***Bold and Italics***  
Markdown also lets you bold words and/or italicize them within your paragraphs. For example, if you want to bold something, simply surround it with a two pairs of ** ** or __ __.  

**
__This text is bolded__
**  

If you want to italicize something, surround it with one pair of * * or _ _.  

_
*This text is italicized*
_  

You can also embed your text as well as both italicize and bold it. Some examples include:  

This text has both **bolded** and *italicized* words within it's sentence. 

To have something both bolded and italicized, simply put three pairs of *** *** or ___ ___.


***This sentence is both bolded and italicized***
