### Growth Mindset

  Those with a growth mindset look to:  

- Overcome challenges and obstacles  
- Strategize problems and solutions  
- Establish a progressive and positive attitude in both the workplace and learning environment  
- Constantly look for areas of improvement in both their work and environment  
- Challenge themselves to improve their skillset  

### Keep Up That Growth  

 1. Don't let an obstacle bring you down; see it as a chance to improve!  
 2. No pain no gain  
 3. It's never too late to ask for help
