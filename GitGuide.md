# Git-Comprehensive-Guide

Version Control: 
*lets you revisit various versions of a file/files by recording changes and revert to previous versions*  
- **Local Version Control:** entails one database on hard disk to store chnages to files  
- **Centralized Version Control:** single server stores changes that can be accessed by multiple people 
- **Distributed Version Control:** allows people to make copies of the CVS^ as data backups, allows various people to work simutaneously 
- **What is Git?:** DVCS that stores data in file system 
  - *Snspshots:* various saved versions of a file
  - *Local Operations:* saves projects history without need of a server and holds necessary information
  - *Tracking Changes:* saves all changes made to a file 
  - *States:*
      - Committed: data stored in local database 
      - Modified: file changed but not committed to database
      - Staged: flagged file's change version to committed version in next snapshot
Remote Repositories:
- **Cloned Reposities:** server named "origin", local branch "master"
- **Seeing Your Remotes:** git remote command
