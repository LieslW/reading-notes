# Boxes  

**CSS** divides the various HTML elements into their own separate boxes  
- controls dimensions, borders, margin, and padding  
- display/visbility properties can hide elements  
 
**Block-level** boxes and **Inline** boxes can be interchangeable   

*CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders
