***Headings***  
Headings are indicated by the "#" and dependent on how many of these you use will result in various sized headings. For example:  

"#" = Level 1 
# This is a Level 1 Heading 
"##" = Level 2 
## This is a Level 2 Heading 
And so forth...  
This is similar to HTML's h1, h2, h3,... heading styles.  
*Don't forget the space between your # and your heading title. Otherwise it will look like this*  

#This is my Heading when I forget the space  
___
***Paragraphs***  
Paragraphs are much more simple. All you need to do is type in your text and separate it with a blank line...

...like this!  
*Don't try formatting your text in Markdown. The computer does it for you!*  
___
***Bold and Italics***  
Markdown also lets you bold words and/or italicize them within your paragraphs. For example, if you want to bold something, simply surround it with a two pairs of ** ** or __ __.  

**
__This text is bolded__
**  

If you want to italicize something, surround it with one pair of * * or _ _.  

_
*This text is italicized*
_  

You can also embed your text as well as both italicize and bold it. Some examples include:  

This text has both **bolded** and *italicized* words within it's sentence. 

To have something both bolded and italicized, simply put three pairs of *** *** or ___ ___.


***This sentence is both bolded and italicized***
