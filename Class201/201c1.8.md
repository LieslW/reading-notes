# Extra Markup  
  
**DOCTYPES** tell browsers which version of HTML you are using  
- *In case of CSS, the use of DOCTYPE can also help browser render page correctly*  

**Comments** help guide the developer(s) throughout their code  
- Not visible in rendered page   
  - Use the `<!-- and -->` markers  

**ID and Class Attributes** help identify particular elements on the page  
- ID: *`<p id="quote">` (text that falls under this tag is then in quote format)*  
- Class: *`<p class="important">` (text emphasized in format since it's considered important information)*  

**Block Elements** start on a new line in the browser   
- *e.g. `<header>` and `<body>` usually start on new lines in the browser*  
- `<div> element groups block-level elements together  
**Inline Elements** continue on the same line   
- *e.g.:*
  - This is one sentence that contains inline texts elements such as `<b>`to make a word in bold `</b>`.  
  - `<span>` element group inline-level elements together  
**`<iframes>`** display other web pages by cutting through the original
- *e.g. a restaurant website page may display a separate web page of Google Maps depicting the address and location*  
- Included elements: src, height, and width  
**`<meta>`** supplies various information on web page  
- *e.g.: description, keywords, author*  
- Not visible to user  
**Escape Characters** used to render special characters on a page
- *e.g. `<`,`>`, and &copy; , use `&lt;` , `&gt;` , and `&copy;`
  - *similar to how markdown uses backticks to describe an element you want to render*
