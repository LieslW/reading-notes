# Structure
The structure of a site allows readers to easily understand and differntiate the content  
- *e.g. Headings establish hierarchy*  

HTML describes the structure of the page (to the computer & browser)  
- Characters within angled brackets: HTML **elements**  
   - Elements made up of 2 tags: opening and closing tag  
      - e.g.  < html > < /html >  
- **Tags** describe information that lies inside  
- **Semantic Tags** provide content to website structure (use as many as possible)
   - e.g  
      - < html >: HTML code within  
      - < head >: info about page itself (not seen)
      - < title >: title seen in tab in the browser (not seen anywhere else)
      - < body >: content of the page within  
      - < div >: divides pages into various sections
      - < h1, h2, h3... >: headings/subheadings within  
      - < p >: paragraph   
- **Attributes** made up of two parts: *name* and *value* , which provide more information of tag content 
   - **name** labels/indicates type of content (always in lowercase) 
   - **value** is the setting for the tag and can have various values (must be in double quotes " " )  
- **Code Management System** lets you separately edit parts of the page instead of having to type the entire HTML code (easier on inexperienced users)
