# Class 01: Introducing React and Components  

***Component-Based Architecture***  

- ensure component reusability 
  - resubility leads to reliability and lower costs
- **components:*** software objects that interact with each other to perform sufficient and easy-to-use functionality
  - *Object-oriented view:* domain and infrastructure classes (analysis and design) used to identify attributes and operations 
  - *Conventional view:* processing logic and involvements 
  - *Process-related view:* built from existing components from a library, ususally for resources like UIs 
- Characteristics:
  - Reusable, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent
- Principles: 
  - intermediary representation that be translated from source code 
  - interaction of components and its characteristics 
- Guidelines:
  - businesses can attain components without any dependency and create new infrastructure
- Conduction:
  - specify components then categorize them 
  - describe processing flow and data 
  - demonstrate key plan and use  
- Advantages: 
  - Easy deployment, reduced cost, easy development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliable, system maintenance and evolution, and independency

1. What is a “component”?
 A component is an easy-to-use software object used with each other to perform sufficient functionality or functionalities
2. What are the characteristics of a component?
Reusable, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent
3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
Easy deployment, reduced cost, easy development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliable, system maintenance and evolution, and independency

***Props***  


1. What is “props” short for?
"Props" is short for properties and is used to pass data from one component to another
2. How are props used in React?
Define an attribute and its value(data), pass it to child component(s) by using Props, then render the Props Data. 
3. What is the flow of props?
It has a uni-directional flow, going from the parent to the child below.

## Things I Want to Know  
1. In what situations would it be inappropiate to use components? 
2. Can there be multiple parents in React or within props?
