# REST  

1. Who is Roy Fielding?  

Roy Fielding laid down the foundation for the web and how it works.  

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?  

A machine doesn't care about the webpage itself, like people do. 

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?  

HTTP is like an "address" for a website. It let syou the exact website you need to go do. It does this using REST.  

4. What does a GET do?  

Gets/retrieves the request.

5. What does a POST do?  

Adds a request. 

6. What does PUT do?  

Replaces a request. 

7. What does PATCH do?  

Updates a request.
