# Structure
The structure of a site allows readers to easily understand and differntiate the content  
- e.g. Headings establish hierarchy  
HTML describes the structure of the page (to the computer & browser)  
- Characters within angled brackets: HTML elements  
   - Elements made up of 2 tags: opening and closing tag  
      - e.g. <html> </html>
