Value your time! Just like how you don't want to waste anyone else's time, don't waste yours because it is just as important. I try to use this mindset when I have a strong desire to procrastinate.

If employers prioritize problem-solving skills first, so should you.  

1. Understand problem domain  
2. Plan your solution  
3. Divide your big problem into smaller problems  
4. If stuck, reassess, take a breather, or ask for help  
5. And finally... practice!

Most important note to solving a problem on a time crunch; plan your time thoroughly and make sure at each step of the process that you understand what you just did before moving on.

One of the key things about "The 5 Whys" is make sure you understand a problem instead of making assumptions about it: 

1. Assemble a team (people familiar with problem or at least ideas on how to fix it)  
2. Define problem (see it action and ask everyone what the problem is)  
3. Ask "why" the problem is occuring to everyone
4. Repeat step 3 often to get a full understanding  
5. Stop: if they are no more "whys", try to solve the problem using the evidence you now have

No one should be penalized for trying or failing. Focus on your end goal and celebrate progress and success.

### Discussion Questions  

___  

1. **What's the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**  

I would say I bring my tenacity and excitement to solve a problem. I do not give up easily, despite being extremely discouraged to do so. And when I am faced with a problem, I usually keep an more upbeat attitude and excitement to solve it than some others.  

2. **What are 3 things I'll start doing to "un-stick" myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**  

- If my code fails, I am not a failure. `Myself != my_code`  

- Celebrate success and improvement! I am a perfectionist and while I don't usually give up on a problem, I do lose those little bits of happiness when it works BETTER than it may have previously. I need to recognize that coding is still a new skill for me and I need to celebrate when I make improvements.  

- Understand a problem before solving the problem. I am 100% guilty of trying to write code for problems before even trying to fully understand them. "I'll figure it out along the way." Yea, no.
