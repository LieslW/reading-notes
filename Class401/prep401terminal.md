After going through Code 201 and 301, I had a pretty solid understanding of The Command Line but still never paid much attention to what was going on behind the scenes. This provided some nice context for understanding.  

## Basic Navigation

Similar to above, I already had a lot of practice moving about within my terminal. However, I learned a lot of new techniques to navigate it instead of the same tricks I had been using. One example is the ../../ trick.

It was interesting to find out that everything is essentially a file and you can tell the difference by the label following it. Also, how to create hidden files.  

## Manual Pages

I had actually been hoping to learn more about the terminal and more shortcuts I could utilize in my everday projects. The fact that I now know that this manual command exists makes this feat a lot easier. Definitely going to utilize this in my free time and become a terminal master.  

## File Manipulation

In my old system, my files were a mess because I couldn't manipulate the directories like I wanted to. I would accidentally create a file in the wrong place and not know how to put a collection of files under one parent unless I went in there and indivdually moved all of them. Hopefully these directory commands will help me prevent that.  

Also the more I go through this tutorial and read the various commands, the more I think to myself I was truly missing out on the full expanse of this interface.  

### Cheat Sheet

Definitely referring to this and the manual if I'm having terminal trouble.
