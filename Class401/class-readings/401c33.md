## JSON Web Tokens

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** are 'an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely tansmitting information between parties as a JSON object'

>Can usually be trusted since objects are usually digitally *signed*

### When:

- `Authorization`: each user request will include the JWT
- `Information Exchange`: Since tokens are signed, they are good way to securely transmit info *(since people will be who they say they are)*

### JWT Structure

> JWT typically looks like: `xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`

- **Header** has two parts, `type` and `signing algorithm`

Example: 

```python

{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

```

- **Payload** contains the claims, which are 'statements about an entity and additional data'.  

*3 Types of Claims*:

- `Registered Claims`: set of predefined and recommended claims to provide set of useful, interoperable claims
    - `iss`(issuer), `exp`(expiration time), `sub`(subject), `aud` (audience), etc
- `Public Claims`: defined at will; to avoid collisions, register in [IANA JSON Web Token Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) or define as URI
- `Private Claims`: custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them *(unregistered and not public)*

Example:

```python
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

- **Signature**

To create, take *header*, the *payload*, *secret*, and *algorithm in header* then sign

Example:

```python
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

> A retrieved JWT looks like a paragraph of gibberish but is acutally divided within the sections classified above

### How do they work?

When user succesfully authenticated, JWT returned

> Tokens are credentials so should not be kept for long

1. The application or client requests authorization to the authorization server
2. When the authorization is granted, the authorization server returns an access token to the application
3. The application uses the access token to access a protected resource (like an API)

### Why should we use JWTs?  

**JWT vs. SWT and SAML**  

- JSON is less verbose (compact)
- Secures tokens by digital signing
- JSON parsers common in programming languages

Overall, JWT used at Internet scale
