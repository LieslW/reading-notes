### Managing Django Settings: Issues  

- **Different environments**: can have several environments with their own specifc settings. Need an approach that keeps all these Django setting configs

- **Sensitive data**: `SECRET_KEY` with each project and other sensitive data which can't  be stored in VCS

- **Sharing settings between team members**: general human error; some developers may add APIs and forget specific settings

- **Django settings are a Python code**: gives flexibility but also has some tricky logic

### Setting Django Configs: Different Approaches  

1. `settings_local.py`
    - **Pros**
        - secrets not in VCS
    - **Cons**
        - not in VCS (can lose some of Django environment settings)
        - need to have example file to share with others
2. Separte setting files for each environment 
    - **Pros**
        - all environments in VCS
        - easy to share settings with others
    - **Cons**
        - difficult to handle secrets passwords/tokens
        - 'inheritance' of settings can be hard to trace/maintain
3. Environment variables
    - **Pros**
        - config separated from code
        - environment parity (same code for all envs)
        - no inheritance; cleaner and consistent code
        - theoretical grounding for using env variables
    - **Cons**
        - handling sharing default config with others

`django-environ`: environment variables perfect place to store settings

**Setting Structure**: instead of splitting settings by envs, can split them by source

**Naming Conventions**:

- give meaningful names to your settings  
- always use prefix with project name for custom settings
- write descriptions using comments
