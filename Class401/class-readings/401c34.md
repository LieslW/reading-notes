### Managing Django Settings: Issues  

- **Different environments**: can have several environments with their own specifc settings. Need an approach that keeps all these Django setting configs

- **Sensitive data**: `SECRET_KEY` with each project and other sensitive data which can't  be stored in VCS

- **Sharing settings between team members**: general human error; some developers may add APIs and forget specific settings

- **Django settings are a Python code**: gives flexibility but also has some tricky logic

### Setting Django Configs: Different Approaches  

1. `settings_local.py`
    - **Pros**
        - secrets not in VCS
    - **Cons**
        - not in VCS (can lose some of Django environment settings)
        - need to have example file to share with others
2. Separte setting files for each environment 
    - **Pros**
        - all environments in VCS
        - easy to share settings with others
    - **Cons**
        - difficult to handle secrets passwords/tokens
        - 'inheritance' of settings can be hard to trace/maintain
3. Environment variables
    - **Pros**
        - config separated from code
        - environment parity (same code for all envs)
        - no inheritance; cleaner and consistent code
        - theoretical grounding for using env variables
    - **Cons**
        - handling sharing default config with others

`django-environ`: environment variables perfect place to store settings

**Setting Structure**: instead of splitting settings by envs, can split them by source

**Naming Conventions**:

- give meaningful names to your settings  
- always use prefix with project name for custom settings
- write descriptions using comments

## SSH Tutorial

**Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)** 'is a remote administration protocol that allows users to access, control, and modify their remote servers over the internet'

SSH is a secure protocol and uses crptographic tecniques to ensure all communication from the remote server is encrypted.

### How Does SSH Work?

**SSH command**: instructs system to open an encrypted SSH 

```python
ssh {user}@{host}
```

- **{user}** represents account to access
- **{host}** refers to computer to access

### Understanding Different Encryption Techniques  

1. Symmetrical Encryption
    - form of encryption where a `secret key` is used for both encryption/decryption  
    - encrypts entire communication during SSH session
2. Asymmetrical Encryption
    - uses two separate keys for encryption/decryption
    - `public key` encrypts message and can be decrypted by `private key`
3. Hashing
    - never meant to be decrypted; generate unique value of length for each input
    - verifies authenticity of messages

### How Does SSH Work With These Encryption Techniques  

1. Both systems must agree upon encryption standards to protect future communications
2. User must authenticate themselves 

> If credentials match, user granted access

### Session Encryption Negotiation

**Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm** creates a `symmetrical key`

How algorithm works:

1. Client/server agree on prime number (aka `seed value`)
2. Client/server agree on common encryption method
3. Client/server generate another prime number
4. New key/number computes public key
5. Client/server use personal private key, machine's public key, and original prime num
6. Client/server share SSH session

Final step, **authenticate user** (usually by passwords)
