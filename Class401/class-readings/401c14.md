**Matplotlib:** most used Python package for 2D graphics

- *IPython:* interactive Python shell with various features such as named inputs/outputs, shell commands, debugging, etc
- *pyplot:* object-oriented plotting library (similar to Matlab and its commands)

### Simple Plots Features:

- **Using defaults** (default settings that are also customizable)
- **Instantiating defaults** (default values but can interact with values)
- **Changing colors and line widths** (change format of lines)
- **Setting limits** (play with limits of the graph)
- **Setting ticks** (values along x and y axis)
- **Setting tick labels** (labels along x and y axis ticks)
- **Moving spines** (moving x and y axis to extend graph)
- **Adding a legend** (labeling lines on graph)
- **Annotate some points** (label various point of the graph)
- **"Devil is in the details"** (adjust any of the above features to make graph visually appealing)

### Figures, Subplots, Axes and Ticks  

___

#### Figures  

The visual window in the GUI. Several parameters:

| Argument    | Default     | Description 
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------  
| num      | 1       |  number of figure
| figsize   | figure.figsize        | figure size in inches (w,h)
| dpi      | figure.dpi       |  resolution in dots per inch
| facecolor      | figure.facecolor       |  color of drawing background
| edgecolor      | figure.edgecolor       |  color of edge around backaground
| frameon      | True       |  draw figure frame or not  
___

#### Subplots  

Arranges plots in regular grid (specify number of rows and columns) 

____

#### Axes

Similar to subplots but allows placement anywhere  

___

#### Ticks

| Class    | Description
| ----------- | -----------
| NullLocator      | No ticks
| IndexLocator      | Place tick on every multiple of some base number of points plotted
| FixedLocator     | Ticks locations are fixed
| LinearLocator      | Determine the tick locations
| MultipleLocator      | Set tick on every int that's a multiple of some base
| AutoLocator      | Select no more than n intervals at nice locations
| LogLocator      | Determine the tick locations for log axes
___  

### Animation

Various animations that can be utilized, such as Drip Drop (simple rain effect)

___
