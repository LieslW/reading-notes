This article references how the developer coded a quiz that was meant, in the viewer's eyes, to give important medical information about a pharmuetical drug. However, it gave you a recommendation no matter the answers to the quiz being coded. As it turns out this drug causes severe depression and lead to the death of many teenage girls.  

This struck an interesting dilemma. It reminds me of those evil monster movies where the evil corporation forces the genius scientist to create a vicious monster, despite it being unethical. Of course, from the outside, we see "oh that's definitely wrong and unethical". However, the scientist might not even know it's happening until it's done.  

This can pose a problem in the developmental world. How many projects have developers built that was unethical in it's overall nature without the developer knowing or thinking about it? I think it is a good lesson to always *THINK* about what you're building before going straight into building it. You may realize you're building something that goes against your morals.

This article brought the ethical dilemma of self-driving cars to the stand. In the case of unavoidable accidents, what should the car do? Should it value the life inside the car, outside of the car, property damage, etc. Human drivers make these split decisions in seconds and there is no "right" answer because it varies from person to person. But a machine doesn't have the ethical and emotional background of a human, it has straightforward instructions telling it what to do. Obviously, self-driving cars are still debating and questioning what to do for this situation.  

I think the only "right" answer for this specifc situation is that this issue is simply addressed. I believe this issue should be addressed despite the difficulty solving it. Ignoring could cause more loss of life and accidents than if it was simply addressed properly.
