# Class 02 Reading: Testing and Modules  

## Test Driven Development  

___
[In Test We Trusts - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

**Test Driven Development** emphasizes tests first before the content of your code. This is a more efficient and reliable way to write code

**Structure:**

    *AAA*
        Arrange: organize data needed to execute a piece of code (input)

        Act: execute code being tested

        Assert: after execution, check if result (output) is what was expected 


Tips:
- Start small  
- Be as descriptive as possible when naming your tests  
- Do tests in separate folder/file; call it your main file's name plus test at the beginning is best way to go about it  
- Use AAA structure 


## What does the if `__name__`= "`__main__`": do?

___
[What does the if `__name__`= "`__main__`": do?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/)

If a Python module is being run by itself via the user, then the `__name__` variable will be defined as '`__main__`'.  

If the script of a module is imported elsewhere, the `__name__` will be the name of script/module.  

This essentially means that Python script be be constantly reused for multiple purposes and be a program all by itself.  

## Recursion  

___

**Recursion** is the process of when a function, a recursive function,, calls and clones itself over and over. As it gets re-called, it can simplify itself to a simpler version of the original code. 

It's nice in terms in which it helps us reduce our code length, which also makes it easier to read and write. However, it does take more memory and can go on infinitely if it doesn't have a base breaking point. 

**Base case** terminates the recursive function when the case = true. If you don't hit the base case, it can cause a stack overflow error.
