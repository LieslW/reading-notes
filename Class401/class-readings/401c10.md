### What's a Stack?  

Data structure consisting of `Nodes`.  

1. ***Push:***  Nodes/items that are put into the stack are pushed  
2. ***Pop:*** Node/items that are removed are popped  
3. ***Top:*** Top of the stack 
4. ***Peek:*** View the value of the `Top` node in the stack
5. ***IsEmpty:*** returns true when stack is empty (otherwise false)  

*Will raise exceptions if stack is empty and try to use 2 and 4
