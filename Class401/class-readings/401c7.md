"Scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code. It determines the visibility of a variable within the code."  

The scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name.  

- ***GLOBAL SCOPE***: defined names in this scope are available to all your code
- ***LOCAL SCOPE***: defined names in this scope are only available/visible to the code within the scope

### LEGB Rule  

- **Local (or function) scope** code block/body of any Python function; names defined within function and can only be visible in such. 
- **Enclosing (or nonlocal scope)** only exists for nested functions; similar to local but the function itself is more nested 
- **Global (or module) scope** top-most scope; contains all names at the top level of a program and are visible everywhere
- **Built-in scope** scope that's created/loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. Contains keywords, functions, exceptions, etc. build into Python

___
| Action | Global Code | Local Code | Nested Function Code
| ----------- | -----------| ----------- | -----------
Access or reference names that live in the global scope |	Yes	| Yes |	Yes 
Modify or update names that live in the global scope |	Yes | 	No (unless declared global) |	No (unless declared global)
Access or reference names that live in a local scope |	No |	Yes (its own local scope), No (other local scope) |	Yes (its own local scope), No (other local scope)
Override names in the built-in scope |	Yes	 | Yes (during function execution) |	Yes (during function execution)
Access or reference names that live in their enclosing scope |	N/A |	N/A	| Yes
Modify or update names that live in their enclosing scope|	N/A	| N/A |	No (unless declared nonlocal)

There are exceptions but **LEGB** is a good rule of thumb to follow by. 

Built-in Scope functions:

- `globals()`: returns reference to current global scope/namespace dictionary
- `locals()`: updates/returns dictionary that holds copy of current state of local Python scope within the local function it's called in
- `dir()`: without arguments, gets list of names in current Python scope
- `vars()`: returns the `.__dict__` attribute of a module, class, instance, etc which has a dicitonary attribute
