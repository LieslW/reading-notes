**Models** "define the *structure* of stored data, including field *types* and possibly also more of their custom/default values".  

> **Make sense of your object before making your model. Then create your model around your object.*

**Multiplicities** represent the minimum and maximum of each model that may be present in the relationship.  

### Defining models  

Defined within `models.py` and implemented as subclasses of `django.db.models.Model`. Code fragment below is a very basic model called **MyModelName**:

```python

from django.db import models
from django.urls import reverse

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    # â€¦

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the URL to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name

```

**Fields** represents a column of data to be stored within a database table. There can be multiple 'fields'.

**Methods**; every model should define the standard Python class method `__str__()` to make the returned string for each object readbale.  

There are a lot of different models to pick one; as said before, pick the one best suited for your object/data.

**Admin** uses the models to auto build a site area that lets you use CRUD. Very useful for managing data.  

1. Register each model within `admin.py`.  
2. Create a 'superuser' account whihc will give the site full access
```python

python manage.py createsuperuser

```
3. Login using /admin url path
4. Interact with your site
