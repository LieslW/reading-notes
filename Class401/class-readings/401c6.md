The **Random Module** in Python allows you to generate random numbers:

1. **Randint** accepts two parameters, lowest and highest number:

```python

import random
print random.randint(0, 5)

```

The above function will output any number from 1-5

2. **Random** gives you a larger number through multiplicaiton:

```python

import random
random.random() * 100

```

3. **Choice** generates random value from the sequence sequence:

```python

import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)

```

Above will choose random value from the list

4. **Shuffle** shuffles elements in a list in place to give them a random order:

```python

from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
Output:
# print x  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
# of course your results will vary

```

5. **Randrange** generates a randomly selected element from range:

```python

random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)

```

## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

A **Risk** is "the probability of any unwanted incident". **Risk Analysis** identifies potential risks in any applications and/or software that was built in order to test them. Risk Analysis allows managers to mitigate the risks, damage, and loss to the core company. 

Some unavoidable risks:

1. *Time* allocated for testing
2. *Defect leakage* due to size/complexity of application
3. Urgency from *clients* to deliver product
4. Incomplete requirements 

Possible solutions:

- Conduct **Risk Assessment** review meeting
- Use **maximum resources** to work on high-risk areas
- Create *Risk Assessment database* for future use
- Identify and notice **risk magnitude indictors**

    - ***HIGH***: damage inreparable and non-tolerable; company would take significant loss
    - ***MEDIUM***: tolerable but not preferable; possible financial loss
    - ***LOW***: tolerable; no exposure or loss


Possible Risks:

1. ### Business Risks

    - most common; may come from company and/or customer, not the product itself

2. ### Testing Risks

3. ### Premature Release Risk 

    - releasing unsatisfactory/untested software 

4. ### Software Risks

Risk Perspectives:

- ***EFFECT***: identify condition, event, or action to determine the impact
- ***CAUSE***: initialize scanning the problem and reach a most probable reason 
- ***LIKELIHOOD***: probability of risk taking place

Steps:

1. Search the risk 
2. Analyze impact 
3. Measures for risk identified
