**Web Scraping** "is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which cna save a huge amount of time and effot."

- Read Website's Terms and Conditions to understand how to *legally* use the data
- Don't download the data too quickly for you may break the site and be blocked 

**Example Code**

```python 

# Import libraries
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Set the URL you want to webscrape from
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'

# Connect to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse HTML and save to BeautifulSoup objectÂ¶
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# To download the whole data set, let's do a for loop through all a tags
line_count = 1 #variable to track what line you are on
for one_a_tag in soup.findAll('a'):  #'a' tags are for links
    if line_count >= 36: #code for text files starts at line 36
        link = one_a_tag['href']
        download_url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/'+ link
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url,'./'+link[link.find('/turnstile_')+1:]) 
        time.sleep(1) #pause the code for a sec
    #add 1 for next line
    line_count +=1

```

Techniques of Web Scraping:

1. **Human Copy and Paste** is exactly what it sounds like 
2. **Text pattern matching** approach based on the UNIX grep command/regular expression-mathcing facilities 
3. **HTTP Programming**; static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using sock programming
4. **HTML parsing** programs and algorithms detect the format of the encoded pages to scrape it easily
5. **DOM parsing** translate the data into DOM tree via client-side scripts
6. **Vertical aggregation** creates bots to retrieve information
7. **Semantic annotation recognizing** small markups made to get specific data snippets
8. **Computer vision web-page analysis** use machine-learning to interpret page as a human might
