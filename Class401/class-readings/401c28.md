**HTML Form**: "group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server."

- can have different data types
- sharing data is secure
- user-friendly

The way Django handles forms:

1. Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.

2. Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.

3. Clean and validate the data.

4. If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.

5. If all data is valid, perform required actions (such as save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, and so on).

6. Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

> **Still have to follow `VUT`*

While creating forms can be difficult, Django has a lot of tools and mechanisms (such as: `declare`, `render`, and `validate`) to make your job as the developer a little easier.
