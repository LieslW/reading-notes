NextJs is a React Framework and provides a solution to creating a React app from scratch

**Features**

 -An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
- Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment with Fast Refresh support
- API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable

### Setup

```python
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
```

```python 
cd nextjs-blog

npm run dev
```

### Navigate Between Pages  

Create file called `first-post.js`

**Using `<Link>`**

```python
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">Back to home</Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  );
}
```

Next.js automatically optimizes your application for the best performance by code splitting, client-side navigation, and prefetching (in production).

## Assets, Metadata, and CSS  

Next.js can serve static **assets** under the top-level public directory. Files inside public can be referenced from the root of the application *(similar to pages)*.

***Example: Adding Image***  

```python 
import Image from 'next/image';

const YourComponent = () => (
  <Image
    src="/images/profile.jpg" // Route of the image file
    height={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    width={144} // Desired size with correct aspect ratio
    alt="Your Name"
  />
);
```


A lot of the tools are similar in the way you typically interact with React. However, you have to import them and reference correctly.  


## React Context for Beginners

React is good for:

- Theme data
- User data
- Location-specific data

**Props drilling** 'is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.'

Using React context:

1. Create context using the `createContext` method
2. Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree
3. Put any value you like on your context provider using the `value` prop
4. Read the value within any component by using the context consumer
