**Dunder Methods**: special methods used to enrich your classes (such as `__int__` or `__str__`)

Object initialization:

`__init__`

Object Representation:

`__str__`, `__repr__`

Iteration:

`__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__reversed__`

Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts:

`__eq__`, `__lt__`

Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts:

`__add__`

Callable Python Objects:

`__call__`

Context Manager Support and with *With* Statement:

`__enter__`, `__exit__`

## Iterators

**Repeaters**

```python
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
for item in repeater:
    print(item)
```

```python
repeater = Repeater('Hello')
iterator = repeater.__iter__()
while True:
    item = iterator.__next__()
    print(item)
```

- Iterators provide a sequence interface to objects thats memory efficient (for loop)
- To support iteration an object needs to implement the iterator protocol by providing the `__iter__` or `__next__` 
- Class iterators are only one way to write iterable objects (consider generators and generator expressions)

## Generators

```python
def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value
```

- Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. Generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based iterators.
- The yield statement allows you to temporarily suspend execution of a generator function and to pass back values from it.
- Generators start raising StopIteration exceptions after control flow leaves the generator function by any means other than a yield statement.
