### What is a Hashtable?

- **Hash** is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be user for either security or other purposes.  
    - In the case of a ***hashtable***, it is used to determine index of an array/list

- **Buckets** is what is contained in each index of the array/list of the hashtable. Each index is a *bucket*. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.  

- **Collisions** is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable

Hashtables are useful for:

- holding unique values
- Dictionary
- Library

A hash code turns a key into an integer.  

> **Hash codes are deterministic; their output is determined only by their input*

#### To create a Hash:

1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values together  
2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599
3. Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array/list
4. Insert into the array/list at that index

Example:

```python

Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16. 

```

#### Hash maps: Storing Values

- accept a key
- calculate the hash of the key
- use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
- store the key **with** the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

#### Hash maps: Reading Values

- accept a key
- calculate the hash of the key
- use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
- use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
- search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given

> **The more buckets a hash map has, the less liklihood of collsions. However, it requires more space*

#### Internal Methods

- `Add()`
- `Find()`
- `Contains()`
- `GetHash()`
