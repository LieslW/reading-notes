## What is Serverless Computing?

"**Serverless** is a cloud application development and execution model that lets developers build and run code without managing servers, and without paying for idle cloud infrastructure."

- focuses on writing quality front-ends
- don't pay for idle capacity

***SERVERLESS != no servers***; simply that the developer does not interact with them 

Serverless is similar to FaaS, a cloud computing service that lets developers run code in response to events/requests without managing the infrastructure required to run it. However, serveless offers more services such as:

- **Serverless databases and storage**: uses models that scale linearly with demand in both infrastructure and pricing
- **Event streaming and messaging**: suited for event-driven and stream-processing wordloads  
- **API gateways**: act as proxies to web actions and provide: HTTP method routing, client ID and secrets, rate limits, CORS, API usage, response logs, API sharing policies, etc

Serverless vs. PaaS, containers, and VMs:

- **Provisioning time**: Measured in milliseconds
- **Administrative burden**: None  
- **Maintenance**: Managed 100% by the provider
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling—including auto-scaling to zero—is instant and inherent  
- **Capacity planning**: None  
- **Statelessness**: Inherent for serverless, which means scalability is never a problem; state is maintained in an external service or resource
- **High availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR)**: Both are inherent with no extra effort and at no additional cost
- **Resource utilization**: 100% efficient because there are no such things thing as idle capacity—it is invoked only upon request
- **Billing granularity and savings**: Metered in units of 100 milliseconds

***PROS***

1. Offers a number of technical and business benefits to individual developers and enterprise development teams

2. Improved developer productivity

3. Pay for execution only

4. Develop in any language

5. Streamlined development/DevOps cycles

6. Cost-effective performance

7. Usage visibility

***CONS***

1. Unacceptable latency for certain applications

2. Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads

3. Monitoring and debugging issues

4. Vendor lock-in
