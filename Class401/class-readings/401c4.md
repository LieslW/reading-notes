# Class 04 Readings

## Classes and Objects

Classes hold variables and functions, then give these to objects.  

Example of basic class:

```python

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("I'm inside class right now")

my_object_x = MyClass()
```

Accesing a function and variable:

```python

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("I'm inside class right now")

my_object_x = MyClass()

my_object_x.variable

my_object_x.function()
```

Finally, the `'__init__'` function (def `__init__`) is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated and is used for assigning values in class.  

## Thinking Recursively

"If the current problem represents a simple case, solve it. if not, divide it into subproblems and apply the same strategy to them." *~ Abhirag Awasthi*  

**Recursive Case:**
Breaks down instances into smaller subproblems

**Base Case:**
The least possible solution to problem [x]. Important to recursion because if there is no base case, the funciton will run indefinitely until it breaks something  

**To Maintain State:**  

- Thread state through each call so current state is part of current call's execution context
- Keep state in global scope (i.e. define outside function)  

"Recursive function's structure can often be modeled after the definition of the recursive data structure it takes as an input." *~ Abhirag Awasthi*  

***Examples of recursive data structures:***  

- List, tree, set, dictionary, etc.  

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

For pytest, there will be a `@pytest.fixture` decorator along with a function definition.  

`@pytest.fixture(scope='[x]')`: **scope** lets you set up an object and use it multiple times without creating it again

To assert that pytest runs all possibilities in your code (*code coverage*), there is a package that can downloaded and installed: `pytest-cov` on PyPI.  

* To invoke pytest, use `--cov` option. 
    - Provide an arugment and the directory (unless you define it further, it will report *every* part of the Python library)
    - Translate the report into HTML/readable report with `coverage html` (will create directory called `htmlcov`)
