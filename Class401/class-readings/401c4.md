Classes hold variables and functions, then give these to objects. 

Example of basic class:
```python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("I'm inside class right now")

my_object_x = MyClass()
```

Accesing a function and variable:
```python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("I'm inside class right now")

my_object_x = MyClass()

my_object_x.variable

my_object_x.function()
```

Finally, the `'__init__'` function (def `__init__`) is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated and is used for assigning values in class.
