In order to improve your hard technical skills, you need to step out of your comfort zone. Learn new things and constantly practice the ones you struggle with. Your career will keep your skills fresh but will not do a lot to expand them.

Deliberate practice should include:

- New concepts beyond your comfort zone  
- Repitition  
- Feedback from peers  
- Hard work
- End goals
