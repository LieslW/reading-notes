Essentially, learning this new skill is going to be a big step out of my and others' comfort zones. However, I need to set myself a goal and remind me of my goal everyday.

***Big Notation O*** describe the complexity of, the execution time required, and/or space used of an algorithm.

**O(1)**: an algorithm that executes in same time/place regardless of size of data

```python
bool IsFirstElementNull(ILsit<String> elements)
{
    return elements[0] == null;
}
```

**O(N)**: an algorithm that grows linearly to the size of the data. Favors worst-case performance scenario or assumes upper limit of iterations algorithm will perform

```python
bool ContainsValue(IEnumerable<string> elements, string value)
{
    foreach (var element in elements)
    {
        if (element == value) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

**ON^2**: an algorithm directly proportional to the square of the size of the data 

```python 
bool ContainsDuplicates(IList<string> elements)
{
    for (var outer =0; outer < elements.Count; outer++)
    {
        for (var inner = 0; inner < elements.Count; inner++)
        {
            if (outer == inner) continue; 
            if (elements[outer] == elements[inner]) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**O(2^N)**: an algorithm whose growth doubles with each new input to the data and the growth is exponential

```python 
int Fibonacci(int number)
{
    if (number <= 1) return number; 
    return Fibonacci(number - 2) + Fibonacci(number - 1);
}
```

***Note:** For the notes and definitions above, look at how the examples are set up

**Logarithms** or *O(logN)* finds the median of a data set over and over when looking for a value until it is found or can no longer split the data. This creates quicker run time and produces a growth that peaks initially then so flattens.
